# 80s_are_back
ACTAM 2024/25 project "80's are back"

This whole repository is intended for the project ' 80's are back ' - the homework we have to submit for the ACTaM 2024/25 exam in group with Corrado Bertazzoni.

The idea is to create a web audio based synthesizer, starting from the specifications of what a synth was back in the early 80's, but taking advantage from today's web audio capabilities.
