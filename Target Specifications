Web Audio based synthesiser

Should work with an external MIDI keyboard

Two Oscillators, both with at least Local Level, Waveform choice, ADRS, Detune, Octave, Semitone settings

One Global filter with at leaast Attack-Decay, Cutoff, Resonance, EG Intensity, Polarity settings

A Global section for Power On/Off, Volume, Tuning, if possible Glide

In the original synths from the 80's there were only limited voices (8 for single oscillator, 4 for two oscillator settings in the Korg 
Poly 800  - this is not a limitation anymore, because of Web Audio.  Still, the originals were not respondig to MIDI Velocity, while this 
project should instead take it into account.  If (or better, when) possible, Pitch Bend Wheel aand Mod Wheel responce should be added

The unit should come with presets, possibly at least 8 at the beginning - future update could be the capabilty of creating new presets
